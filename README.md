# MarcelOS
A simple 32 bit Operating System named after 3 generations of my Grandpas name "Marcelo".

## How to run the OS
You will need to install build-essential, Clang, LLD, Make, and QEMU in your terminal.

If you are just on linux or mac run "cd kernel && make all" (need to be in the OS directory)
If you are using wsl on windows you can use either the command above or run the batch file (make sure QEMU is in your system path)
